### Ariel Levy, Eric Stringham, Sally Bao

We used text files of each candidate's campaign website, counting the frequency of different words in the text files.

We sourced the text files from the github repository of James Davenport (https://github.com/jradavenport/issues-2016/tree/master/text).

We represented words as bubbles, with bubble size proportional to frequency of appearance.
